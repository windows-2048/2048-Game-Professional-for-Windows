2048 Game help.

This application is designed to be as simple in use, as possible.

You start playing instantly by arrows keys or by mouse click-moves. Then, you may exit application or switch to another game (4x4, 8x8 or 16x16) at any time.

All game state is automatically saved each time you change something on the game field (but starting new game is the only action without game saving). So you may resume paying at any time by switching back to previous game, or after application exit or even after power supply crush.

If your boss is coming indoors and seeing your display, just press 'Esc' to instantly exit (and of course with game saved). You may restart application later and continue from the automatically saved point.
