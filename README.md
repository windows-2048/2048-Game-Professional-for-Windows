Github Back-end for 2048 Game Professional for Windows
=============================================================================================

This is a Github-based back-end for source code of my 2048 game girls edition.

This is a professional open source application for Windows. The 2048 puzzle includes playing fields 4x4, 8x8, 16x16 with automatic game savings at each motion step. My program allows you to grow your own kitty to a mature cat pokemon and compete with your friends. It has been designed and programmed from scratch to deliver very soft and comfortable playing experience in 2048 puzzle ever.

If you are unfamiliar with build from sources, download latest versions of our software at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/exe-2048/
or right here from the releases tab.

Note 1. License has been changed to GPLv3.
Note 2. Source code tree has been significantly reorganized since 2048 Game Professional for Windows version 1.5.5.0 has been released.
