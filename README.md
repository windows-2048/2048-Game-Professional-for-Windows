Award Winning 2048 Game Girls Edition For Windows Desktop Free Download
=============================================================================================

Two Thousand Forty Eight again?! No. As Italians says: 'Di Nuovo'. As you know, author of original 2048 iPhone/Android game is Italian guy, Gabriele Cirulli.

We are two student girls, Dasha Vigi & Masha Novedad, and we have decided to rewrite famous 2048 game from scratch to bring it to the Windows 7 8 10 PC Desktop. We have applied our design view and added exciting features. 

Why we found Windows 7 8 10 PC Desktop to be perspective? Because we are students, and we make almost all our stuff using personal computer or notebook, but not a smartphone. Often we strain hard making homework, and we need a small relax without leaving PC environment. Because if we are leaving PC and switching to smartphone, we can not come back. Understand us, we are just young students. :)

We made our edition of 2048 game with careful love and intriguing features.
